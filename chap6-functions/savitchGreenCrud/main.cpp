The Fibonacci numbers Fn are defined as follows. F0 is 1, F1 is 1, and 
i = 0, 1, 2, .... In other words, each number is the sum of the previous 
two numbers. The first few Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. One 
place that these numbers occur is as certain population growth rates. If a 
population has no deaths, then the series shows the size of the population 
after each time period. It takes an organism twoâ€¢time periods to mature to 
reproducing age, and then the organism reproduces once every time period. The formula applies most straightforwardly to asexual reproduction 
at a rate of one offspring per time period. 
Assume that the green crud population grows at this rate and has a time period of 5 days. Hence, if a green crud population starts out as 10 pounds of 
crud, then in 5 days there is still 10 pounds of crud; in 10 days there is 20 
pounds of crud, in 15 days 30 pounds, in 20 days 50 pounds, and so forth. 
Write a program that takes both the initial size of a green crud population 
(in pounds) and a number of days as input, and that outputs the number 
of pounds of green crud after that many days. A~~ume that the population 
size is the same for 4 days and then increases evdy fifth day. Your program 
should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as desired.
